## **League Functions**## **Team Functions**## **Historical Analysis Functions**## **Player Functions**## **Game Functions**Let me continue testing the remaining functions systematically...Now let me test some of the remaining functions that might have different behaviors:# **COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS**

## ❌ **NOT WORKING Functions**

### **Roster Functions** (All fail with same error)
- `get_team_roster` ❌ Returns "Unknown" placeholders
- `get_team_roster_player_info_by_week` ❌ `'Name' object has no attribute 'get'`
- `get_team_roster_player_info_by_date` ❌ (Likely same error)
- `get_team_roster_player_stats` ❌ `'Name' object has no attribute 'get'`
- `get_team_roster_player_stats_by_week` ❌ (Likely same error)

### **Player Functions**
- `get_league_players` ❌ `'Name' object has no attribute 'get'`
- `get_player_stats_by_week` ❌ `'Name' object has no attribute 'get'`
- `get_player_stats_by_date` ❌ (Likely same error)
- `get_player_stats_for_season` ❌ (Likely same error)
- `get_player_ownership` ❌ (Likely same error)
- `get_player_percent_owned_by_week` ❌ (Likely same error)
- `get_player_draft_analysis` ❌ (Likely same error)

### **Team Stats**
- `get_team_standings` ❌ Returns "Unknown" data
- `get_team_stats` ❌ Returns "Unknown" data
- `get_team_stats_by_week` ❌ (Likely same error)

### **Other Functions**
- `get_user_teams` ❌ Returns generic "Football" names instead of actual teams
- `get_current_user` ❌ Returns "Unknown" data

## 🔄 **WORKING BUT EMPTY** (Historical data functions)
These work but return empty results (likely because it's a new league):
- `get_historical_drafts` ✅ Works but empty
- `analyze_manager_history` ✅ Works but empty  
- `analyze_draft_strategy` ✅ Works but empty
- `predict_trade_likelihood` ✅ Works but empty
- `evaluate_manager_skill` ✅ Works but empty

## 🚧 **PARAMETER ISSUES**
- `get_season_transactions` ❌ Season parameter handling issue
- `get_matchups` ❌ Week parameter validation issue (works without week param)

## **KEY FINDING**
The primary issue appears to be in **player data parsing** - anything that tries to extract detailed player information from Yahoo's API responses fails with `'Name' object has no attribute 'get'`. This suggests a parsing bug in how player objects are processed from the Yahoo API JSON response.

The **league-level data** and **basic team metadata** work perfectly, but **roster/player-specific data** consistently fails.

===

Good question! When I say "working but empty," I mean the functions execute successfully without errors and return properly structured JSON responses, but the data sections are empty or contain zero results.

Let me show you exactly what I mean with examples:

## **Example 1: `get_historical_drafts`**
**Status:** ✅ Works but empty
**Response:**
```json
{
  "league_id": "333417",
  "sport": "nfl", 
  "seasons_analyzed": [],  // ← Empty array
  "drafts": {},           // ← Empty object
  "total_seasons": 0      // ← Zero count
}
```

## **Example 2: `analyze_manager_history`**  
**Status:** ✅ Works but empty
**Response:**
```json
{
  "league_id": "333417",
  "sport": "nfl",
  "seasons_analyzed": ["2024", "2023", "2022"],  // ← Tries to analyze these seasons
  "team_filter": null,
  "manager_analysis": {},      // ← Empty object (no data found)
  "total_managers": 0          // ← Zero managers analyzed
}
```

## **Example 3: `predict_trade_likelihood`**
**Status:** ✅ Works but empty  
**Response:**
```json
{
  "league_id": "333417",
  "sport": "nfl", 
  "seasons_analyzed": ["2024", "2023", "2022"],  // ← Tries to look at these seasons
  "all_trade_pairs": {},       // ← Empty (no trades found)
  "most_active_pairs": [],     // ← Empty array
  "total_unique_pairs": 0      // ← Zero pairs found
}
```

## **What This Means:**

1. **Function Logic Works:** The functions don't crash and return well-structured responses
2. **No Historical Data Found:** They can't find any historical league data for your league ID across previous seasons
3. **Likely Reasons:**
   - Your league might be new (first year)
   - League ID might have changed between seasons  
   - Historical data might not be accessible via the API for this league
   - The league might have been recreated rather than renewed

This is different from the **roster functions** which completely fail with errors, or functions that return **"Unknown" placeholder data**. These historical functions work properly but just don't find any past data to analyze.

Does that clarify the distinction?
