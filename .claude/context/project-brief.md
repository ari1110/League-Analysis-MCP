## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Zero Technical Barrier Analytics
**Problem**: Traditional fantasy analytics tools require complex setup, API key management, and technical expertise  
**Solution**: Conversational authentication through AI assistants with 30-second automated OAuth

### 2. Historical Depth & Intelligence
**Problem**: Most tools focus on current season only, missing long-term patterns and trends  
**Solution**: 10+ years of historical data with advanced behavioral analysis and pattern recognition

### 3. AI-Native Integration
**Problem**: Existing tools are web-based, requiring context switching and manual data interpretation  
**Solution**: Native MCP protocol integration enabling AI assistants to provide contextual insights

### 4. Manager Behavioral Intelligence
**Problem**: No tools analyze manager behavior patterns, draft strategies, or trade likelihood  
**Solution**: Comprehensive manager profiling with skill evaluation and predictive analytics

## Project Boundaries

### Technical Boundaries
- **Platform**: Yahoo Fantasy Sports only (no ESPN, NFL.com, etc.)
- **Transport**: MCP protocol over stdio (no REST API or web interface)
- **Data Storage**: In-memory caching only (no persistent database)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 only (no alternative auth methods)

### Functional Boundaries
- **Analysis Focus**: Historical patterns and manager behavior (not predictive modeling for player performance)
- **User Interface**: AI assistant integration only (no direct user interfaces)
- **Scope**: League-level analytics (not individual player performance prediction)
- **Automation**: Data access and analysis only (no automated league management)

### Business Boundaries
- **Monetization**: Open source project (no paid features or subscriptions)
- **Support**: Community-driven support through GitHub issues
- **Distribution**: PyPI and uvx installation only
- **Usage**: Personal and educational use (commercial users responsible for Yahoo API compliance)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Yahoo Fantasy Sports API**
   - **Risk**: API changes or deprecation could break functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Robust error handling, comprehensive testing, community monitoring

2. **OAuth Token Management**
   - **Risk**: Token expiration or invalidation disrupts service
   - **Mitigation**: Automatic refresh, clear re-authentication guidance, fallback flows

3. **FastMCP Framework** 
   - **Risk**: Framework updates may introduce breaking changes
   - **Mitigation**: Version pinning, thorough testing, migration planning

### Technical Risks
1. **Rate Limiting Violations**
   - **Risk**: Exceeding Yahoo API limits could result in temporary or permanent restrictions
   - **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, request throttling, usage monitoring

2. **Memory Usage Growth**
   - **Risk**: Cache growth could consume excessive system memory
   - **Mitigation**: Size-limited cache with LRU eviction, monitoring and alerting

3. **Authentication Complexity**
   - **Risk**: OAuth failures could prevent user access
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple OAuth flows, detailed troubleshooting, automated diagnostics
